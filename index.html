           <p>Classic. Just take the label off a water bottle, write the answers on the inside, put label back on. As simple as that.</p>
        </div>
       <div class="section-content method-two">
           <p>With invisible ink it's as easy as pie! Simply write down all your answers on a blank piece of paper with the invisible ink. Then when you need it, simply shine the light on the paper, and TADAH! You now have all the answers!</p>
        </div>
       <div class="section-content method-three">
           <p>This one is a little more convoluted, but still effective. Most teachers will have you put your phone in your bag right? Well just slip the phone in your shoe before the test. Answer as many of the questions as possible on the test as you can, and the the ones you don't know blank. When you reach the end, ask the teacher if you can go to the bathroom. When you get to the bathroom, simply take the phone out of your shoe and look up all the answers! Then walk back to your class with a smug look knowing your gonna destroy that test!</p>
        </div>
       <div class="section-content method-four">
           <p>If you have a pair of glasses, and easy way to cheat is to write down all the answers on a micro-fiber cloth used for your glasses. Just pretend to clean your glasses and look at the answers. If you want to add an extra layer of sneakiness, have a spare cloth with nothing on it. If the teacher gets suspicious just hand them the one without writing on it. GENIUS!</p>
        </div>
       <div class="section-content method-five">
           <p>This is the best method of cheating. Just memorize all the knowledge in your head prior to the test and you'll pass with flying colors! Just make sure to get plenty of sleep.</p>
